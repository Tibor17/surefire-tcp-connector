Motivated by:

- [netty](https://github.com/deepanprabhu/netty-twoway-tcp-client-server)
- [java-api](https://javadeveloperszone.wordpress.com/2013/04/20/java-tcp-chat-multiple-client/) and [example](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/javanetexamples/)

The commandline of `netty` project:

```
t2 = 1825 millis
t3 = 0 millis
t4 = 52 millis
t5 = 43 millis
Received Message : Hello

Received Message : Hello There

Received Message : Thanks For Reply !!
```

The pure TCP/IP server starts up within `5 milli seconds`.
